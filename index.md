Hi! 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Swedish Institute for Social Research, Stockholm University. My research revolves - broadly speaking - around intergenerational mobility and the inheritance of disadvantage. I am particularly interested in the underlying causal mechanisms driving intergenerational associations, with a focus on early childhood conditions and health.
